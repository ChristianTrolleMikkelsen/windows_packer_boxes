windows_packer_boxes
====================

Repository with instructions for packer to build windows server 2012 R2 boxes.

This repository is a modified edition of https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows brilliant repo. However i did so many things differently an wanted another name for my repo which aims directly at using vagrant.
